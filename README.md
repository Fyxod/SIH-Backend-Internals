### Problem Statement Title

Smart Irrigation System for Precision Farming

### Description

Background: Water scarcity is a major challenge in agriculture, leading to inefficient water use and reduced crop yields. Traditional irrigation methods often result in overuse or underuse of water. Description: Develop a smart irrigation system that utilizes sensors and IoT technology to monitor soil moisture levels and weather conditions. This system will provide real-time data to farmers, enabling them to make informed decisions on irrigation scheduling, thus optimizing water usage and enhancing crop yield. Expected Solution: A smart irrigation module integrated with moisture sensors and a mobile application to provide farmers with timely irrigation alerts and recommendations based on real-time data.
